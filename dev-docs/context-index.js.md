# encodeImage index.js
## Imported Code Object
Certainly! Here's a concise explanation of the `encodeImage` function:

The `encodeImage` function takes an image file path as input and converts the image into a Base64-encoded string. Here's what it does:

1. It reads the contents of the image file using `fs.readFileSync()`.
2. It creates a Buffer from the image data.
3. It converts the Buffer to a Base64-encoded string using `toString('base64')`.

This Base64 encoding allows the image to be represented as a text string, which can be useful for transmitting image data over text-based protocols or storing it in text-based formats.

### Third Party Libaries

No, this function does not use any third-party APIs or libraries; it only uses Node.js built-in modules (fs and Buffer) to read an image file and encode it to base64.

### Security Issues

Yes, there are potential security issues related to file path manipulation and arbitrary file read if the `imagePath` parameter is not properly validated and sanitized before use.

# getUniqueColors index.js
## Imported Code Object
In this code snippet, `getUniqueColors` is an asynchronous function that takes an image file path as input and returns an array of unique colors found in the image. Here's a concise explanation of what it does:

1. It reads the image file using the Jimp library.
2. It scans through every pixel of the image.
3. For each non-transparent pixel, it extracts the RGBA values.
4. It converts the RGBA values to an integer representation of the color.
5. It adds this color integer to a Set, which automatically ensures uniqueness.
6. Finally, it converts the Set of unique colors back to an array and returns it.

The function effectively creates a list of all distinct colors present in the image, ignoring fully transparent pixels.

### Third Party Libaries

Yes, this function uses the third-party library Jimp (JavaScript Image Manipulation Program) for reading and processing the image.

### Security Issues

In a brief sentence, potential security issues could arise from processing untrusted image files, as maliciously crafted images might exploit vulnerabilities in the image processing library (Jimp) or consume excessive resources.

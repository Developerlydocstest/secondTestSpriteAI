# removeBackgroundColor index.js
## Imported Code Object
The `removeBackgroundColor` function is an asynchronous operation that processes an image to remove a specified background color. Here's a concise explanation of its functionality:

1. It takes an input image file, an output path, a target color to remove, and optional parameters for color threshold and additional options.

2. The function uses the Jimp library to read and manipulate the image.

3. It scans through each pixel of the image, comparing its color to the specified target color.

4. If a pixel's color is within the specified threshold of the target color, it makes that pixel transparent by setting its alpha value to 0.

5. Finally, it saves the processed image with the transparent background to the specified output path.

In essence, this function allows you to remove a specific background color from an image, replacing it with transparency.

# encodeImage index.js
## Imported Code Object
Certainly! Here's a concise explanation of the `encodeImage` function in the given code snippet:

The `encodeImage` function takes an image file path as input and performs the following steps:

1. It reads the contents of the image file using `fs.readFileSync(imagePath)`.
2. It creates a Buffer object from the file contents using `Buffer.from(image)`.
3. Finally, it converts the Buffer to a base64-encoded string using `.toString('base64')`.

The purpose of this function is to convert an image file into a base64-encoded string representation, which can be useful for embedding images in HTML, sending them over networks, or storing them in databases that don't support binary data directly.

### Third Party Libaries

No, this function does not use any third-party APIs or libraries; it only uses Node.js built-in modules (fs and Buffer) to read an image file and encode it to base64.

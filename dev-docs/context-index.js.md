# encodeImage index.js
## Imported Code Object
Certainly! Here's a concise explanation of the `encodeImage` function:

The `encodeImage` function takes an image file path as input and performs the following steps:

1. It reads the contents of the image file using `fs.readFileSync()`.
2. It creates a Buffer object from the image data.
3. It converts the Buffer to a base64-encoded string representation.
4. Finally, it returns the base64-encoded string.

This function is commonly used to convert image files into a format that can be easily transmitted or stored as text, such as in JSON payloads or databases that don't support binary data directly.

### Third Party Libaries

No, this function does not use any third-party APIs or libraries; it only uses Node.js built-in modules (fs and Buffer) to read an image file and convert it to a base64 string.

# getUniqueColors index.js
## Imported Code Object
In this code snippet, `getUniqueColors` is an asynchronous function that takes an image file path as input and returns an array of unique colors found in the image. Here's a concise explanation of its functionality:

1. It reads the image file using Jimp library.
2. It scans through each pixel of the image.
3. For each non-transparent pixel, it extracts the RGBA values.
4. It converts the RGBA values to an integer representation of the color.
5. It adds each unique color (as an integer) to a Set to eliminate duplicates.
6. Finally, it returns an array of all unique colors found in the image.

The function essentially analyzes the image and provides a list of all distinct colors present in it, ignoring fully transparent pixels.

### Third Party Libaries

Yes, this function uses the third-party library Jimp for image processing and color manipulation.

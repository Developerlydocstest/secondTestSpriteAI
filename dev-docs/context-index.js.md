# encodeImage index.js
## Imported Code Object
Certainly! Here's a concise explanation of the `encodeImage` function in the given code snippet:

The `encodeImage` function takes an image file path as input and performs the following steps:

1. It reads the contents of the image file using `fs.readFileSync()`.
2. It converts the file contents into a Buffer object.
3. It then encodes the Buffer to a base64 string using `toString('base64')`.

The purpose of this function is to convert an image file into a base64-encoded string representation. This encoding allows the image data to be easily transmitted or stored as text, which is useful for various purposes such as embedding images in HTML or sending them over network protocols that only support text data.

### Third Party Libaries

No, this function does not use any third-party APIs or libraries; it only uses Node.js built-in modules (fs and Buffer) to read an image file and encode it to base64.

# getUniqueColors index.js
## Imported Code Object
In this code snippet, `getUniqueColors` is an asynchronous function that takes an image file path and an optional options object as parameters. Its purpose is to analyze the image and return an array of unique colors found in the image. Here's a concise explanation of what it does:

1. It reads the image file using the Jimp library.
2. It scans through every pixel of the image.
3. For each non-transparent pixel, it extracts the RGBA color values.
4. It converts the RGBA values to an integer representation of the color.
5. It adds this color integer to a Set to ensure uniqueness.
6. Finally, it returns an array of all unique colors found in the image.

The function essentially processes the image to identify and collect all distinct colors present, ignoring fully transparent pixels.

### Third Party Libaries

Yes, this function uses the third-party library Jimp (JavaScript Image Manipulation Program) for reading and processing the image.

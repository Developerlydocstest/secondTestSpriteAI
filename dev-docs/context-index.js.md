# getUniqueColors index.js
## Imported Code Object
The `getUniqueColors` function is an asynchronous function that takes an `imagePath` (a string representing the file path of an image) and an optional `options` object as input parameters. Its purpose is to read the image from the specified file path and return an array of unique color integers present in the image.

Here's a breakdown of what the function does:

1. It reads the image from the specified `imagePath` using the `Jimp.read` method provided by the Jimp library (a library for image processing).

2. It creates a new `Set` called `colorSet` to store unique color integers.

3. It iterates over all the pixels in the image using the `image.scan` method, which provides the pixel's coordinates (`x`, `y`) and its index (`idx`) in the image data array (`this.bitmap.data`).

4. For each pixel, it retrieves the red, green, blue, and alpha (transparency) values from the image data array.

5. If the alpha value is not zero (i.e., the pixel is not fully transparent), it converts the red, green, blue, and alpha values into a single integer color representation using the `Jimp.rgbaToInt` method.

6. The converted color integer is added to the `colorSet` using the `colorSet.add` method. Since `Set` only stores unique values, this ensures that only unique color integers are stored.

7. After iterating over all pixels, the function returns an array created from the `colorSet` using `Array.from(colorSet)`, which contains all the unique color integers present in the image.

In summary, the `getUniqueColors` function reads an image and returns an array of unique color integers that represent the colors present in the image, ignoring fully transparent pixels.

### Sample Parameters For Code Feature Fridays

Sure, the `getUniqueColors` function takes two arguments:

1. `imagePath` (required): A string representing the path to the image file you want to process.
2. `options` (optional): An object containing optional settings for the image processing. In the provided code, it's set to an empty object by default.

Here's an example of how you can use this function:

```javascript
const imagePath = './path/to/your/image.jpg';

getUniqueColors(imagePath)
  .then(uniqueColors => {
    console.log('Unique colors:', uniqueColors);
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error('Error:', error);
  });
```

In this example, we're passing the `imagePath` as a string representing the path to the image file we want to process. The function will return a Promise that resolves with an array of unique color integers (represented as numbers) present in the image.

If you need to pass additional options, you can do so by providing an object as the second argument:

```javascript
const imagePath = './path/to/your/image.jpg';
const options = {
  // Add any desired options here
};

getUniqueColors(imagePath, options)
  .then(uniqueColors => {
    console.log('Unique colors:', uniqueColors);
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error('Error:', error);
  });
```

Currently, the provided code doesn't define any specific options, but you could extend it to accept additional configuration options if needed.

Note that this code uses the `Jimp` library for image processing, so you'll need to have it installed in your project to use the `getUniqueColors` function. You can install it using npm:

```
npm install jimp
```

And make sure to import or require the `Jimp` library in your code:

```javascript
const Jimp = require('jimp');
// or
import Jimp from 'jimp';
```

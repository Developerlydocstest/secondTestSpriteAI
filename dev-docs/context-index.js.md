# removeBackgroundColor index.js
## Imported Code Object
The `removeBackgroundColor` function is an asynchronous operation that processes an image to remove a specified background color. Here's a concise explanation:

1. It takes an input image path, output path, target color, and optional parameters.
2. The function uses the Jimp library to read and manipulate the image.
3. It scans through each pixel of the image.
4. For each pixel, it compares its color to the specified target color.
5. If the color difference is within the given threshold, it makes that pixel transparent.
6. Finally, it saves the processed image to the output path.

In essence, this function allows you to remove a specific background color from an image, replacing it with transparency.

# encodeImage index.js
## Imported Code Object
Certainly! Here's a concise explanation of the `encodeImage` function in the given code snippet:

The `encodeImage` function takes an image file path as input and performs the following steps:

1. It reads the contents of the image file using `fs.readFileSync()`.
2. It creates a Buffer object from the image data.
3. It converts the Buffer to a base64-encoded string using `toString('base64')`.

The purpose of this function is to convert an image file into a base64-encoded string representation, which can be useful for tasks such as embedding images in HTML or sending image data over networks.

### Third Party Libaries

No, this function does not use any third-party APIs or libraries; it only uses Node.js built-in modules (fs and Buffer) to read an image file and encode it to base64.

# getUniqueColors index.js
## Imported Code Object
The `getUniqueColors` function is an asynchronous function that analyzes an image file and returns an array of unique colors found in that image. Here's a concise explanation of its functionality:

1. It takes an image file path as input and optional options.
2. It uses the Jimp library to read and process the image.
3. It scans through each pixel of the image.
4. For each non-transparent pixel, it extracts the RGBA color values.
5. It converts the RGBA values to an integer representation of the color.
6. It adds each unique color (as an integer) to a Set to eliminate duplicates.
7. Finally, it returns an array of all unique colors found in the image.

This function is useful for analyzing the color palette of an image or finding the distinct colors used in an image.

### Third Party Libaries

Yes, this function uses the third-party library Jimp for image processing and color manipulation.
### Third Party Libaries

undefined

# encodeImage index.js
## Imported Code Object
Certainly! Here's a concise explanation of the `encodeImage` function in the given code snippet:

The `encodeImage` function takes an image file path as input and performs the following steps:

1. It reads the contents of the image file using `fs.readFileSync()`.
2. It creates a Buffer object from the image data.
3. It converts the Buffer to a base64-encoded string representation of the image.
4. It returns this base64-encoded string.

This process effectively converts an image file into a text-based format (base64) that can be easily transmitted or stored as a string. This is commonly used when you need to include image data in JSON payloads or when working with APIs that expect image data in a text format.

### Third Party Libaries

No, this function does not use any third-party APIs or libraries; it only uses Node.js built-in modules (fs and Buffer) to read an image file and encode it to base64.

# getUniqueColors index.js
## Imported Code Object
`getUniqueColors` is an asynchronous function that processes an image file to extract unique colors from it. Here's a concise explanation of what it does:

1. It reads an image file using the Jimp library.
2. It scans through every pixel of the image.
3. For each non-transparent pixel, it converts the RGBA values to an integer representation of the color.
4. It adds each unique color integer to a Set, which automatically eliminates duplicates.
5. Finally, it returns an array of all the unique color integers found in the image.

This function is useful for analyzing the color palette of an image or for tasks that require knowledge of the distinct colors used in an image.

### Third Party Libaries

Yes, this function uses the third-party library Jimp (JavaScript Image Manipulation Program) for reading and processing the image.

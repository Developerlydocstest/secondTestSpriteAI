# removeBackgroundColor index.js
## Imported Code Object
The `removeBackgroundColor` function is an asynchronous function designed to remove a specific background color from an image. Here's a concise explanation of its functionality:

1. It takes an input image file, processes it, and saves the result to an output file.

2. The function allows specifying a target color to remove, along with a color threshold for flexibility.

3. It uses the Jimp library to read and manipulate the image.

4. The function scans through each pixel of the image, comparing its color to the target color.

5. If a pixel's color is within the specified threshold of the target color, it is made transparent by setting its alpha value to 0.

6. The resulting image, with the specified background color removed, is then saved to the output path.

In essence, this function automates the process of removing a specific background color from an image, creating a transparency where that color was present.

### Third Party Libaries

Yes, this function uses the third-party library Jimp (JavaScript Image Manipulation Program) for image processing and manipulation.

# encodeImage index.js
Certainly! Here's a concise explanation of the `encodeImage` function in the given code snippet:

The `encodeImage` function takes an image file path as input and performs the following steps:

1. It reads the contents of the image file using `fs.readFileSync()`.
2. It converts the file contents into a Buffer object.
3. It then converts the Buffer to a base64-encoded string using `toString('base64')`.

The purpose of this function is to convert an image file into a base64-encoded string representation, which can be useful for embedding images in JSON, sending them over the network, or storing them in databases that don't support binary data directly.

### Third Party Libaries

No, this function does not use any third-party APIs or libraries; it only uses Node.js built-in modules (fs and Buffer) to read an image file and encode it to base64.

# getUniqueColors index.js
## Imported Code Object
In this code snippet, `getUniqueColors` is an asynchronous function that takes an image file path and optional parameters as input. Its purpose is to analyze the image and return an array of unique colors found in the image. Here's a concise explanation of what it does:

1. It reads the image file using the Jimp library.
2. It scans every pixel of the image.
3. For each non-transparent pixel, it extracts the RGBA color values.
4. It converts the RGBA values to an integer representation of the color.
5. It adds each unique color (as an integer) to a Set to eliminate duplicates.
6. Finally, it returns an array of all unique colors found in the image.

This function is useful for color analysis, palette extraction, or any task that requires identifying the distinct colors used in an image.

### Third Party Libaries

Yes, this function uses the third-party library Jimp (JavaScript Image Manipulation Program) for reading and processing the image.

# encodeImage index.js
## Imported Code Object
Certainly! Here's a concise explanation of the `encodeImage` function in the given code snippet:

The `encodeImage` function takes an image file path as input and performs the following steps:

1. It reads the contents of the image file using `fs.readFileSync()`.
2. It converts the file contents into a Buffer object.
3. It then encodes the Buffer into a base64 string representation.
4. Finally, it returns the base64-encoded string of the image.

This function is commonly used to convert image files into a format that can be easily transmitted or stored as text, such as in JSON payloads or databases that don't support binary data directly.

### Third Party Libaries

No, this function does not use any third-party APIs or libraries; it only uses Node.js built-in modules (fs and Buffer) to read an image file and encode it to base64.

# getUniqueColors index.js
## Imported Code Object
In this code snippet, `getUniqueColors` is an asynchronous function that:

1. Takes an image file path as input.
2. Reads the image using the Jimp library.
3. Scans through every pixel of the image.
4. For each non-transparent pixel, it converts the RGBA color values to an integer representation.
5. Stores these unique color integers in a Set to eliminate duplicates.
6. Finally, returns an array of all unique colors found in the image.

The function essentially analyzes an image and extracts a list of all distinct colors used in it, ignoring fully transparent pixels.

### Third Party Libaries

Yes, this function uses the third-party library Jimp (JavaScript Image Manipulation Program) for reading and processing the image.

# encodeImage index.js
## Imported Code Object
Certainly! Here's a concise explanation of the `encodeImage` function in the given code snippet:

The `encodeImage` function takes an image file path as input and performs the following steps:

1. It reads the contents of the image file using `fs.readFileSync()`.
2. It converts the file contents into a Buffer object.
3. It then encodes the Buffer as a base64 string using `toString('base64')`.
4. Finally, it returns the base64-encoded string representation of the image.

This function essentially converts an image file into a base64-encoded string, which can be useful for embedding images directly in HTML or sending them as part of JSON data in APIs.

### Third Party Libaries

No, this function does not use any third-party APIs or libraries; it only uses Node.js built-in modules (fs and Buffer) to read a file and encode it to base64.

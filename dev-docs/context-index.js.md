# encodeImage index.js
## Imported Code Object
Certainly! Here's a concise explanation of the `encodeImage` function in the given code snippet:

The `encodeImage` function takes an image file path as input and performs the following steps:

1. It reads the contents of the image file using `fs.readFileSync()`.
2. It converts the file contents into a Buffer object.
3. It then encodes the Buffer into a base64 string using `toString('base64')`.

The purpose of this function is to convert an image file into a base64-encoded string representation, which can be useful for embedding images in text-based formats or transmitting them over text-based protocols.

### Third Party Libaries

No, this function does not use any third-party APIs or libraries; it only uses built-in Node.js modules (fs for file system operations and Buffer for handling binary data).

# removeBackgroundColor index.js
## Imported Code Object
The `removeBackgroundColor` function is an asynchronous function designed to remove a specific background color from an image. Here's a concise explanation of its functionality:

1. It takes an input image path, output path, target color to remove, and optional parameters like color threshold and additional options.

2. The function uses the Jimp library to read and process the image.

3. It scans through each pixel of the image, comparing its color to the specified target color.

4. If a pixel's color is within the specified threshold of the target color, it sets that pixel to transparent by adjusting its alpha value.

5. Finally, it saves the processed image with the background color removed to the specified output path.

In essence, this function allows you to remove a specific background color from an image, replacing it with transparency, which can be useful for tasks like creating cutouts or preparing images for overlays.

# encodeImage index.js
## Imported Code Object
Certainly! Here's a concise explanation of the `encodeImage` function in the given code snippet:

The `encodeImage` function takes an image file path as input and performs the following steps:

1. It reads the contents of the image file using `fs.readFileSync()`.
2. It converts the file contents into a Buffer object.
3. It then converts the Buffer to a base64-encoded string using `toString('base64')`.

The purpose of this function is to convert an image file into a base64-encoded string representation, which can be useful for various purposes such as embedding images in HTML or sending them over network protocols that expect text-based data.

### Third Party Libaries

# getUniqueColors index.js
## Imported Code Object
The `getUniqueColors` function is an asynchronous function that analyzes an image file and returns an array of unique colors found in that image. Here's a concise explanation of its functionality:

1. It takes an image file path as input and optional options.
2. It uses the Jimp library to read and process the image.
3. It scans through each pixel of the image.
4. For each non-transparent pixel, it extracts the RGBA color values.
5. It converts the RGBA values to an integer representation of the color.
6. It adds each unique color (as an integer) to a Set to eliminate duplicates.
7. Finally, it returns an array of all unique colors found in the image.

This function is useful for analyzing the color palette of an image or finding the distinct colors used in an image.

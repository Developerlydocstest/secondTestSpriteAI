# encodeImage index.js
## Imported Code Object
Certainly! Here's a concise explanation of the `encodeImage` function in the given code snippet:

The `encodeImage` function takes an image file path as input and performs the following steps:

1. It reads the contents of the image file using `fs.readFileSync()`.
2. It creates a Buffer object from the image data.
3. It converts the Buffer to a base64-encoded string using `toString('base64')`.

The purpose of this function is to convert an image file into a base64-encoded string representation, which can be useful for embedding images in HTML, sending images over network protocols, or storing image data in text-based formats.

### Third Party Libaries

No, this function does not use any third-party APIs or libraries; it only uses built-in Node.js modules (fs and Buffer) to read an image file and encode it to base64.

# getUniqueColors index.js
## Imported Code Object
In this code snippet, `getUniqueColors` is an asynchronous function that takes an image file path and an optional options object as parameters. Its purpose is to analyze the image and return an array of unique colors found in the image.

The function performs the following steps:

1. Reads the image file using the Jimp library.
2. Scans through each pixel of the image.
3. For each non-transparent pixel, it extracts the RGBA color values.
4. Converts the RGBA values to an integer representation of the color.
5. Adds the color integer to a Set to ensure uniqueness.
6. Finally, it returns an array of unique color integers found in the image.

This function can be useful for color analysis, palette extraction, or other image processing tasks that require identifying the distinct colors present in an image.

### Third Party Libaries

Yes, this function uses the third-party library Jimp for image processing and manipulation.

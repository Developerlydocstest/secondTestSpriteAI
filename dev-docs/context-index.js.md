# encodeImage index.js
## Imported Code Object
Certainly! Here's a concise explanation of `encodeImage` in the given code snippet:

The `encodeImage` function takes an image file path as input and converts the image to a Base64-encoded string. It does this by:

1. Reading the image file using `fs.readFileSync()`.
2. Converting the file contents to a Buffer.
3. Encoding the Buffer to a Base64 string using `toString('base64')`.

This Base64-encoded string can be used to represent the image data in a text format, which is useful for embedding images in JSON, sending them over networks, or storing them in databases that don't support binary data directly.

### Third Party Libaries

No, this function does not use any third-party APIs or libraries; it only uses Node.js built-in modules (fs and Buffer) to read an image file and encode it to base64.

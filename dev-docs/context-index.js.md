# encodeImage index.js
## Imported Code Object
Certainly! Here's a concise explanation of the `encodeImage` function in the given code snippet:

The `encodeImage` function takes an image file path as input and performs the following steps:

1. It reads the contents of the image file using `fs.readFileSync()`.
2. It creates a Buffer object from the file contents.
3. It converts the Buffer to a base64-encoded string representation of the image.
4. Finally, it returns this base64-encoded string.

This process effectively converts an image file into a text-based representation that can be easily transmitted or stored as a string, which is useful for various purposes such as embedding images in JSON or sending them over network protocols that only support text.

### Third Party Libaries

No, this function does not use any third-party APIs or libraries; it only uses Node.js built-in modules (fs and Buffer) to read an image file and encode it to base64.

# getUniqueColors index.js
## Imported Code Object
In this code snippet, `getUniqueColors` is an asynchronous function that:

1. Takes an image file path as input.
2. Reads the image using the Jimp library.
3. Scans through every pixel of the image.
4. For each non-transparent pixel, it converts the RGBA color values to an integer representation.
5. Stores these unique color integers in a Set to eliminate duplicates.
6. Finally, returns an array of all unique colors found in the image.

The function essentially analyzes an image and extracts a list of all distinct colors used in it, ignoring fully transparent pixels.

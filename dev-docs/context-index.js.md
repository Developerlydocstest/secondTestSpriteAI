# encodeImage index.js
## Imported Code Object
Certainly! Here's a concise explanation of the `encodeImage` function in the provided code snippet:

The `encodeImage` function takes an image file path as input and performs the following steps:

1. It reads the contents of the image file using `fs.readFileSync()`.
2. It converts the image data into a Buffer object.
3. It then encodes the Buffer content to a base64 string using `toString('base64')`.

The purpose of this function is to convert an image file into a base64-encoded string representation, which can be useful for various purposes such as embedding images in HTML or sending image data over network protocols.

### Third Party Libaries

No, this function doesn't use any third-party APIs or libraries; it only uses Node.js built-in modules (fs and Buffer) to read an image file and encode it to base64.

# getUniqueColors index.js
## Imported Code Object
`getUniqueColors` is an asynchronous function that takes an image file path as input and returns an array of unique colors found in the image. Here's a concise explanation of its functionality:

1. It reads the image file using the Jimp library.
2. It scans through every pixel of the image.
3. For each non-transparent pixel, it extracts the RGBA color values.
4. It converts the RGBA values to an integer representation of the color.
5. It adds this color integer to a Set to ensure uniqueness.
6. Finally, it returns an array of all unique color integers found in the image.

This function is useful for analyzing the color palette of an image or for color-related image processing tasks.

# getUniqueColors index.js
## Imported Code Object
The `getUniqueColors` function is an asynchronous function that takes an image file path (`imagePath`) and an optional `options` object as input. Its purpose is to read the image file, scan through all the pixels, and return a list of unique colors present in the image.

Here's a breakdown of what the function does:

1. It reads the image file using the `Jimp.read` method, which returns a Promise that resolves with the image data.
2. It creates an empty `Set` called `colorSet` to store unique color values.
3. It uses the `image.scan` method to iterate over each pixel in the image. For each pixel, it retrieves the red, green, blue, and alpha (transparency) values.
4. If the alpha value is not zero (meaning the pixel is not fully transparent), it converts the red, green, blue, and alpha values into a single integer color value using the `Jimp.rgbaToInt` function.
5. It adds this integer color value to the `colorSet`, which automatically filters out duplicate values due to the nature of Sets.
6. After scanning all pixels, it converts the `colorSet` back into an array using `Array.from(colorSet)` and returns this array, which contains the unique color values present in the image.

The purpose of this function is to provide a way to extract and analyze the color palette of an image. By getting the unique colors, you can identify the dominant colors, analyze the color distribution, or perform other color-related operations on the image.

### Sample Parameters

The `getUniqueColors` function takes two arguments:

1. `imagePath`: This is a string representing the path to the image file you want to analyze.
2. `options` (optional): This is an object that allows you to pass additional options to the function. By default, it is an empty object `{}`.

Here's an example of how you can call the `getUniqueColors` function and log the result:

```javascript
const imagePath = 'path/to/your/image.jpg';

getUniqueColors(imagePath)
  .then(uniqueColors => {
    console.log('Unique colors:', uniqueColors);
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error('Error:', error);
  });
```

In this example, we're passing the `imagePath` as the first argument to the `getUniqueColors` function. The function returns a Promise that resolves with an array of unique color integers (represented as integers) present in the image.

If you want to pass additional options, you can provide an object as the second argument. For example:

```javascript
const imagePath = 'path/to/your/image.jpg';
const options = {
  // Add any options you want to pass here
};

getUniqueColors(imagePath, options)
  .then(uniqueColors => {
    console.log('Unique colors:', uniqueColors);
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error('Error:', error);
  });
```

Currently, the code doesn't seem to have any options defined, but you can extend it to accept additional options if needed.

Keep in mind that this code uses the `jimp` library for image processing, so you'll need to have it installed in your project. You can install it by running `npm install jimp` or `yarn add jimp` in your project directory.

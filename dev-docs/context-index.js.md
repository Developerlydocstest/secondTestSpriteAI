# encodeImage index.js
## Imported Code Object
Certainly! Here's a concise explanation of the `encodeImage` function:

The `encodeImage` function takes an image file path as input and performs the following steps:

1. It reads the contents of the image file using `fs.readFileSync()`.
2. It creates a Buffer object from the image data.
3. It converts the Buffer to a base64-encoded string using `toString('base64')`.

The purpose of this function is to convert an image file into a base64-encoded string representation. This encoding is useful for transmitting binary image data as text, which can be easily included in JSON payloads or used in data URLs for web applications.

### Third Party Libaries

The `encodeImage` function uses only built-in Node.js modules (`fs` and `Buffer`) and does not rely on any third-party APIs or libraries.

# getUniqueColors index.js
## Imported Code Object
In this code snippet, `getUniqueColors` is an asynchronous function that takes an image file path as input and returns an array of unique colors found in the image. Here's a concise explanation of what it does:

1. It reads the image file using the Jimp library.
2. It scans every pixel of the image.
3. For each non-transparent pixel, it extracts the RGBA color values.
4. It converts the RGBA values to an integer representation of the color.
5. It adds each unique color integer to a Set to eliminate duplicates.
6. Finally, it returns an array of all unique color integers found in the image.

This function is useful for analyzing the color palette of an image or finding the number of distinct colors used in an image.

### Third Party Libaries

Yes, this function uses the third-party library Jimp for image processing and color manipulation.

# removeBackgroundColor index.js
## Imported Code Object
The `removeBackgroundColor` function is an asynchronous function designed to remove a specified background color from an image. Here's a concise explanation of its purpose and functionality:

1. It takes an input image path, output path, target color, and optional parameters.
2. The function uses the Jimp library to process the image.
3. It scans through each pixel of the image.
4. For each pixel, it compares its color to the specified target color.
5. If the color difference is within a given threshold, it makes that pixel transparent.
6. The resulting image with the removed background is then saved to the specified output path.

In essence, this function automates the process of removing a specific background color from an image, which can be useful for tasks like creating transparent PNGs or isolating objects in images.

### Third Party Libaries

Yes, this function uses the third-party library Jimp for image processing and manipulation.

# encodeImage index.js
## Imported Code Object
Certainly! Here's a concise explanation of the `encodeImage` function in the given code snippet:

The `encodeImage` function takes an image file path as input and performs the following steps:

1. It reads the contents of the image file using `fs.readFileSync()`.
2. It converts the binary image data into a Buffer object.
3. It then encodes the Buffer into a base64 string using `toString('base64')`.

The purpose of this function is to convert an image file into a base64-encoded string representation, which can be useful for embedding images directly in text-based formats or transmitting image data over text-based protocols.

### Third Party Libaries

No, this function does not use any third-party APIs or libraries; it only uses Node.js built-in modules (fs and Buffer) to read an image file and encode it to base64.

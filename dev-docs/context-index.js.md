# encodeImage index.js
## Imported Code Object
Certainly! Here's a concise explanation of the `encodeImage` function in the given code snippet:

The `encodeImage` function takes an image file path as input and performs the following steps:

1. It reads the contents of the image file using `fs.readFileSync()`.
2. It creates a Buffer object from the image data.
3. It converts the Buffer to a base64-encoded string representation of the image.
4. It returns this base64-encoded string.

This process effectively converts an image file into a text-based format (base64) that can be easily transmitted or stored as a string. This is commonly used when you need to include image data in JSON payloads or when working with APIs that expect image data in a text format.

### Third Party Libaries

No, this function does not use any third-party APIs or libraries; it only uses Node.js built-in modules (fs and Buffer) to read an image file and encode it to base64.

### Third Party Libaries

No, this function does not use any third-party APIs or libraries; it only uses the built-in Node.js modules 'fs' for file system operations and 'Buffer' for handling binary data.

# getUniqueColors index.js
## Imported Code Object
In this code snippet, `getUniqueColors` is an asynchronous function that takes an image file path as input and returns an array of unique colors found in the image. Here's a concise explanation of what it does:

1. It reads the image file using the Jimp library.
2. It scans through each pixel of the image.
3. For each non-transparent pixel, it extracts the RGBA color values.
4. It converts the RGBA values to an integer representation of the color.
5. It adds each unique color (as an integer) to a Set to eliminate duplicates.
6. Finally, it returns an array of all unique colors found in the image.

The function effectively analyzes an image and provides a list of all distinct colors used in that image, ignoring fully transparent pixels.

### Third Party Libaries

Yes, this function uses the third-party library Jimp (JavaScript Image Manipulation Program) for reading and processing the image.

# getUniqueColors index.js
## Imported Code Object

The getUniqueColors function takes in an imagePath string representing the path to an image file, and an optional options object. 

It uses the Jimp library to read the image from the imagePath. It then iterates through every pixel in the image, gets the color of each pixel, and adds unique colors to a Set. This allows it to find all the unique colors in the image efficiently.

Finally, it converts the Set to an Array and returns it, giving the caller an array containing the integer values of every unique color in the image.

# undefined index.js
## Imported Code Object

undefined in JavaScript refers to a value that has not been assigned or declared. When a variable is declared but not initialized, its value is undefined. It is also returned from functions that don't explicitly return a value. So in the code snippet provided, since there is no context or code shown, "undefined" itself is likely just referring to the abstract concept of an undefined value in JavaScript.

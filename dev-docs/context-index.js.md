# encodeImage index.js
## Imported Code Object
Certainly! Here's a concise explanation of the `encodeImage` function:

The `encodeImage` function takes an image file path as input and performs the following steps:

1. It reads the contents of the image file using `fs.readFileSync()`.
2. It creates a Buffer object from the image data.
3. It converts the Buffer to a base64-encoded string using `toString('base64')`.

The purpose of this function is to convert an image file into a base64-encoded string representation. This encoding is useful for transmitting binary image data as text, which can be easily included in JSON payloads or used in data URLs for web applications.

### Third Party Libaries

The `encodeImage` function uses only built-in Node.js modules (`fs` and `Buffer`) and does not rely on any third-party APIs or libraries.

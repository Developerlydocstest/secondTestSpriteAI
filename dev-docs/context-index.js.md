# removeBackgroundColor index.js
## Imported Code Object
The `removeBackgroundColor` function is an asynchronous operation that processes an image to remove a specified background color. Here's a concise explanation of its functionality:

1. It takes an input image path, output path, target color to remove, and optional parameters like color threshold and additional options.

2. The function uses the Jimp library to read and manipulate the image.

3. It scans through each pixel of the image, comparing its color to the specified target color.

4. If a pixel's color is within the specified threshold of the target color, it makes that pixel transparent by setting its alpha value to 0.

5. Finally, it saves the processed image with the transparent background to the specified output path.

In essence, this function allows you to remove a specific background color from an image, replacing it with transparency, which is useful for tasks like creating cutouts or removing unwanted backgrounds from images.

# getUniqueColors index.js
## Imported Code Object
The `getUniqueColors` function is an asynchronous function that analyzes an image file and returns an array of unique colors found in that image. Here's a concise explanation of its functionality:

1. It takes an image file path as input and optional options.
2. It uses the Jimp library to read and process the image.
3. It scans through each pixel of the image.
4. For each non-transparent pixel, it extracts the RGBA color values.
5. It converts the RGBA values to an integer representation of the color.
6. It adds each unique color (as an integer) to a Set to eliminate duplicates.
7. Finally, it returns an array of all unique colors found in the image.

This function is useful for analyzing the color palette of an image or finding the distinct colors used in an image.

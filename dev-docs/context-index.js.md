# getUniqueColors index.js
## Imported Code Object
The `getUniqueColors` function in this code snippet is an asynchronous function that analyzes an image file and returns an array of unique colors found in that image. Here's a concise explanation of its functionality:

1. It takes an image file path as input and optional parameters.
2. It uses the Jimp library to read and process the image.
3. It scans every pixel of the image, extracting the RGBA values.
4. For each non-transparent pixel, it converts the color to an integer representation.
5. It stores these unique color integers in a Set to eliminate duplicates.
6. Finally, it returns an array of all unique colors found in the image.

This function is useful for color analysis, palette extraction, or any task that requires identifying the distinct colors present in an image.

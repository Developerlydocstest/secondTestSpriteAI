# encodeImage index.js
## Imported Code Object
Certainly! Here's a concise explanation of the `encodeImage` function in the provided code snippet:

The `encodeImage` function takes an image file path as input and performs the following steps:

1. It reads the contents of the image file using `fs.readFileSync()`.
2. It converts the image data into a Buffer object.
3. It then encodes the Buffer content into a base64 string representation.
4. Finally, it returns the base64-encoded string of the image.

This function is commonly used to convert image files into a format that can be easily transmitted or stored as text, such as in JSON payloads or databases that don't support binary data directly.

### Third Party Libaries

No, this function does not use any third-party APIs or libraries; it only uses Node.js built-in modules (fs and Buffer) to read an image file and encode it to base64.

# getUniqueColors index.js
## Imported Code Object
In this code snippet, `getUniqueColors` is an asynchronous function that processes an image file to extract and return a list of unique colors present in the image. Here's a concise explanation of its functionality:

1. It reads an image file using the Jimp library.
2. It scans every pixel of the image.
3. For each non-transparent pixel, it converts the RGBA values to an integer representation of the color.
4. It adds each unique color (as an integer) to a Set to eliminate duplicates.
5. Finally, it returns an array of these unique color integers.

This function is useful for analyzing the color palette of an image or for tasks that require knowledge of the distinct colors used in an image.

### Third Party Libaries

Yes, this function uses the third-party library Jimp (JavaScript Image Manipulation Program) for reading and processing the image.

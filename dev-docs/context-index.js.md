# encodeImage index.js
## Imported Code Object
Certainly! Here's a concise explanation of the `encodeImage` function in the given code snippet:

The `encodeImage` function takes an image file path as input and performs the following steps:

1. It reads the contents of the image file using `fs.readFileSync()`.
2. It creates a `Buffer` object from the image data.
3. It converts the `Buffer` to a base64-encoded string using `toString('base64')`.
4. Finally, it returns the base64-encoded string representation of the image.

This function is commonly used to convert image files into a format that can be easily transmitted or stored as text, such as in JSON payloads or databases that don't support binary data directly.

### Third Party Libaries

No, this function doesn't use any third-party APIs or libraries; it only uses built-in Node.js modules (fs and Buffer) to read an image file and convert it to a base64 string.

No, this function does not use any third-party APIs or libraries; it only uses Node.js built-in modules (fs and Buffer) to read an image file and encode it to base64.
### Third Party Libaries

No, this function does not use any third-party APIs or libraries; it only uses the built-in Node.js modules 'fs' for file system operations and 'Buffer' for handling binary data.

# getUniqueColors index.js
## Imported Code Object
`getUniqueColors` is an asynchronous function that takes an image file path and optional parameters as input. Its purpose is to analyze the image and return an array of unique colors found in the image. Here's a brief explanation of what it does:

1. It reads the image file using the Jimp library.
2. It scans through every pixel of the image.
3. For each non-transparent pixel, it extracts the RGBA (Red, Green, Blue, Alpha) values.
4. It converts the RGBA values to an integer representation of the color.
5. It adds each unique color (as an integer) to a Set to eliminate duplicates.
6. Finally, it returns an array of all the unique colors found in the image.

This function can be useful for color analysis, palette extraction, or other image processing tasks that require identifying the distinct colors present in an image.

### Third Party Libaries

Yes, this function uses the third-party library Jimp (JavaScript Image Manipulation Program) for reading and processing the image.

# removeBackgroundColor index.js
## Imported Code Object
`removeBackgroundColor` is an asynchronous function that processes an image to remove a specified background color. Here's a concise explanation of its functionality:

1. It takes an input image file path, output file path, target color to remove, and optional parameters like color threshold and additional options.

2. The function uses the Jimp library to read and manipulate the image.

3. It converts the target color to a hex value.

4. The function then scans each pixel of the image, comparing its color to the target color.

5. If a pixel's color is within the specified threshold of the target color, it makes that pixel transparent by setting its alpha value to 0.

6. Finally, it saves the processed image to the specified output path and returns the result.

This function is useful for removing or making transparent specific background colors in images, which can be helpful in various image processing tasks.

### Third Party Libaries

Yes, this function uses the third-party library Jimp for image processing and manipulation.

### Code Example

Certainly! Here's a brief code example of how to use the `removeBackgroundColor` function:

```javascript
const Jimp = require('jimp');

async function main() {
  const inputPath = 'path/to/input/image.jpg';
  const outputPath = 'path/to/output/image.png';
  const targetColor = '#FFFFFF'; // White background color
  const colorThreshold = 30; // Adjust this value to fine-tune the color matching

  try {
    await removeBackgroundColor(inputPath, outputPath, targetColor, colorThreshold);
    console.log('Background removed successfully!');
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error removing background:', error);
  }
}

main();
```

In this example:

1. We import the Jimp library (make sure it's installed: `npm install jimp`).

2. We define a `main` function to handle the asynchronous operations.

3. We specify the input image path, output image path, target color to remove (in this case, white), and a color threshold.

4. We call the `removeBackgroundColor` function with these parameters.

5. If successful, it logs a success message; otherwise, it logs an error.

6. Finally, we call the `main` function to execute the process.

Make sure to replace `'path/to/input/image.jpg'` and `'path/to/output/image.png'` with your actual input and output file paths.

You can adjust the `targetColor` to match the background color you want to remove, and fine-tune the `colorThreshold` to control how strictly the color matching is performed.

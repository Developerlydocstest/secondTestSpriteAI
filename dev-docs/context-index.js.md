# getUniqueColors index.js
## Imported Code Object
The `getUniqueColors` function is an asynchronous function that takes an image file path (`imagePath`) and an optional `options` object as input. Its purpose is to read the image file and return an array of unique color integers present in the image.

Here's a breakdown of what the function does:

1. It reads the image file using the `Jimp.read` method, which returns a Promise that resolves with the loaded image data.
2. It creates a `Set` called `colorSet` to store unique color integers.
3. It scans through every pixel of the image using the `image.scan` method, which provides the pixel coordinates (`x`, `y`), and the index (`idx`) of the pixel data in the `bitmap.data` array.
4. For each pixel, it retrieves the red, green, blue, and alpha (transparency) values from the `bitmap.data` array.
5. If the alpha value is not zero (i.e., the pixel is not fully transparent), it does the following:
   - Converts the red, green, blue, and alpha values into a single integer color representation using the `Jimp.rgbaToInt` function.
   - Adds the color integer to the `colorSet` using the `add` method, which ensures that only unique color integers are stored.
6. After scanning the entire image, it converts the `colorSet` (a Set) to an array using the `Array.from` method and returns the array of unique color integers.

In summary, the `getUniqueColors` function scans through an image pixel by pixel, converts the color values of each non-transparent pixel to an integer representation, and returns an array containing only the unique color integers found in the image. This can be useful for tasks like color analysis, palette extraction, or image processing operations that require knowledge of the unique colors present in an image.

### Sample Parameters

The `getUniqueColors` function takes two arguments: `imagePath` and `options`.

1. `imagePath`: This is a required argument and represents the path to the image file that you want to analyze for unique colors. It should be a string.

2. `options`: This is an optional argument and represents additional options for processing the image. It should be an object, but if you don't need to pass any options, you can omit it.

Here's an example of how you can use the `getUniqueColors` function:

```javascript
const imagePath = 'path/to/your/image.jpg';

getUniqueColors(imagePath)
  .then((uniqueColors) => {
    console.log('Unique colors:', uniqueColors);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error('Error:', error);
  });
```

In this example, we're passing the `imagePath` as a string representing the path to the image file we want to analyze. Since we're not passing any options, we can omit the second argument.

The `getUniqueColors` function returns a Promise that resolves with an array of unique color integers (represented as numbers). Each color integer represents an RGBA color value, where the red, green, blue, and alpha components are packed into a single 32-bit integer.

If you need to pass additional options, you can provide an object as the second argument. For example:

```javascript
const imagePath = 'path/to/your/image.jpg';
const options = {
  // Add your options here
};

getUniqueColors(imagePath, options)
  .then((uniqueColors) => {
    console.log('Unique colors:', uniqueColors);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error('Error:', error);
  });
```

Note that the provided code doesn't include any options, so you would need to modify the `getUniqueColors` function to handle and process the options you want to pass.

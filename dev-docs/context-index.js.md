# encodeImage index.js
## Imported Code Object
Certainly! Here's a concise explanation of the `encodeImage` function in the given code snippet:

The `encodeImage` function takes an image file path as input and performs the following steps:

1. It reads the contents of the image file using `fs.readFileSync()`.
2. It creates a Buffer object from the file contents.
3. It converts the Buffer to a base64-encoded string representation of the image.
4. Finally, it returns this base64-encoded string.

This process effectively converts an image file into a text-based representation that can be easily transmitted or stored as a string, which is useful for various purposes such as embedding images in JSON or sending them over network protocols that only support text.

### Third Party Libaries

No, this function does not use any third-party APIs or libraries; it only uses Node.js built-in modules (fs and Buffer) to read an image file and encode it to base64.

# getUniqueColors index.js
## Imported Code Object
In this code snippet, `getUniqueColors` is an asynchronous function that takes an image file path as input and returns an array of unique colors found in the image. Here's a concise explanation of what it does:

1. It reads the image file using the Jimp library.
2. It scans every pixel of the image.
3. For each non-transparent pixel, it converts the RGBA values to an integer representation of the color.
4. It adds each unique color (as an integer) to a Set to eliminate duplicates.
5. Finally, it returns an array of all unique colors found in the image.

The function essentially analyzes the image and provides a list of all distinct colors used in it, ignoring fully transparent pixels.

### Third Party Libaries

Yes, this function uses the third-party library Jimp (JavaScript Image Manipulation Program) for reading and processing the image.

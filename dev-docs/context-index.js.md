# encodeImage index.js
## Imported Code Object
Certainly! Here's a concise explanation of the `encodeImage` function in the given code snippet:

The `encodeImage` function takes an image file path as input and performs the following steps:

1. It reads the contents of the image file using `fs.readFileSync()`.
2. It converts the file contents into a Buffer object.
3. It then encodes the Buffer into a base64 string using `toString('base64')`.

The purpose of this function is to convert an image file into a base64-encoded string representation, which can be useful for embedding images in text-based formats or transmitting them over text-based protocols.

### Third Party Libaries

No, this function does not use any third-party APIs or libraries; it only uses built-in Node.js modules (fs for file system operations and Buffer for handling binary data).

# getUniqueColors index.js
## Imported Code Object
In this code snippet, `getUniqueColors` is an asynchronous function that takes an image file path and optional parameters as input. Its purpose is to analyze the image and return an array of unique colors found in the image.

The function performs the following steps:
1. Reads the image using the Jimp library.
2. Scans every pixel of the image.
3. Extracts the RGBA values for each non-transparent pixel.
4. Converts the RGBA values to an integer representation of the color.
5. Adds each unique color to a Set to eliminate duplicates.
6. Finally, converts the Set of unique colors to an array and returns it.

This function is useful for tasks such as color analysis, palette extraction, or determining the color diversity in an image.

### Third Party Libaries

Yes, this function uses the third-party library Jimp for image processing and color manipulation.

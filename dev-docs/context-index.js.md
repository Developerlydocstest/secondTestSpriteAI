# encodeImage index.js
Certainly! Here's a concise explanation of the `encodeImage` function:

The `encodeImage` function takes an image file path as input and performs the following steps:

1. It reads the contents of the image file using `fs.readFileSync()`.
2. It converts the file contents into a Buffer object.
3. It then encodes the Buffer into a base64 string representation.
4. Finally, it returns the base64-encoded string.

This function is commonly used to convert image files into a format that can be easily transmitted or stored as text, such as in JSON payloads or databases that don't support binary data directly.

### Third Party Libaries

No, this function does not use any third-party APIs or libraries; it only uses Node.js built-in modules (fs and Buffer) to read an image file and encode it to base64.

# getUniqueColors index.js
In this code snippet, `getUniqueColors` is an asynchronous function that takes an image file path and an optional options object as parameters. Its purpose is to analyze the image and return an array of unique colors found in the image.

The function performs the following steps:
1. Reads the image file using the Jimp library.
2. Scans through each pixel of the image.
3. For each non-transparent pixel, it converts the RGBA color values to an integer representation.
4. Adds the integer color value to a Set to ensure uniqueness.
5. Finally, it converts the Set of unique colors back to an array and returns it.

This function is useful for identifying and extracting the palette of colors used in an image.

### Third Party Libaries

Yes, this function uses the third-party library Jimp for image processing and color manipulation.

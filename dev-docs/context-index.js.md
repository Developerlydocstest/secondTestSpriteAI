# encodeImage index.js
## Imported Code Object
Certainly! Here's a concise explanation of the `encodeImage` function in the given code snippet:

The `encodeImage` function takes an image file path as input and converts the image into a Base64-encoded string. Here's what it does:

1. It reads the contents of the image file using `fs.readFileSync()`.
2. It creates a Buffer from the image data.
3. It converts the Buffer to a Base64-encoded string using `toString('base64')`.

This process is commonly used to represent binary image data as a text string, which can be easily transmitted or stored in text-based formats (e.g., JSON, XML, or databases that don't support binary data directly).

### Third Party Libaries

No, this function does not use any third-party APIs or libraries; it only uses Node.js built-in modules (fs for file system operations and Buffer for handling binary data).

# getUniqueColors index.js
## Imported Code Object
In this code snippet, `getUniqueColors` is an asynchronous function that takes an image file path as input and returns an array of unique colors found in the image. Here's a concise explanation of what it does:

1. It reads the image file using the Jimp library.
2. It scans every pixel of the image.
3. For each non-transparent pixel, it extracts the RGBA color values.
4. It converts the RGBA values to an integer representation of the color.
5. It adds each unique color integer to a Set to eliminate duplicates.
6. Finally, it returns an array of all unique color integers found in the image.

This function is useful for analyzing the color palette of an image or finding the number of distinct colors used in an image.

### Third Party Libaries

Yes, this function uses the third-party library Jimp for image processing and color manipulation.

# encodeImage index.js
## Imported Code Object
Certainly! Here's a concise explanation of the `encodeImage` function in the provided code snippet:

The `encodeImage` function takes an image file path as input and performs the following steps:

1. It reads the contents of the image file using `fs.readFileSync()`.
2. It creates a Buffer object from the image data.
3. It converts the Buffer to a base64-encoded string using `toString('base64')`.

The purpose of this function is to convert an image file into a base64-encoded string representation, which can be useful for various purposes such as embedding images in HTML or sending them over network protocols that require text-based data.

### Third Party Libaries

No, this function does not use any third-party APIs or libraries; it only uses Node.js built-in modules (fs and Buffer) to read an image file and encode it to base64.

# getUniqueColors index.js
## Imported Code Object
The `getUniqueColors` function in this code snippet is an asynchronous function that analyzes an image file and returns an array of unique colors found in the image. Here's a concise explanation:

1. It takes an image file path and optional options as parameters.
2. It uses the Jimp library to read and process the image.
3. It scans every pixel of the image, extracting the RGBA values.
4. For each non-transparent pixel, it converts the RGBA values to an integer representation of the color.
5. It stores these color integers in a Set to ensure uniqueness.
6. Finally, it returns an array of all unique colors found in the image.

This function is useful for color analysis, palette extraction, or any task that requires identifying the distinct colors present in an image.

# encodeImage index.js
## Imported Code Object
Certainly! Here's a concise explanation of the `encodeImage` function in the given code snippet:

The `encodeImage` function takes an image file path as input and performs the following steps:

1. It reads the contents of the image file using `fs.readFileSync()`.
2. It converts the file contents into a Buffer object.
3. It then encodes the Buffer into a base64 string representation.
4. Finally, it returns the base64-encoded string of the image.

This function is commonly used to convert image files into a format that can be easily transmitted or stored as text, such as in JSON payloads or databases that don't support binary data directly.

### Third Party Libaries

No, this function does not use any third-party APIs or libraries; it only uses Node.js built-in modules (fs and Buffer) to read an image file and encode it to base64.

# getUniqueColors index.js
## Imported Code Object
In this code snippet, `getUniqueColors` is an asynchronous function that takes an image file path as input and returns an array of unique colors found in the image. Here's a concise explanation of its functionality:

1. It reads the image file using Jimp library.
2. It scans through each pixel of the image.
3. For each non-transparent pixel, it extracts the RGBA values.
4. It converts the RGBA values to an integer representation of the color.
5. It adds this color integer to a Set to ensure uniqueness.
6. Finally, it returns an array of all unique color integers found in the image.

The function essentially processes an image and identifies all distinct colors present in it, ignoring fully transparent pixels.

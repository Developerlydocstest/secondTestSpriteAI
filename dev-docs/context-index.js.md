# removeBackgroundColor index.js
## Imported Code Object
The `removeBackgroundColor` function is an asynchronous function that processes an image to remove a specified background color. Here's a concise explanation of its purpose and functionality:

1. It takes an input image file path, an output path, a target color to remove, and optional parameters for color threshold and other options.

2. The function uses the Jimp library to read and manipulate the image.

3. It scans through each pixel of the image, comparing its color to the specified target color.

4. If a pixel's color is within the specified threshold of the target color, it makes that pixel transparent by setting its alpha value to 0.

5. The resulting image, with the background color removed, is then saved to the specified output path.

In essence, this function automates the process of removing a specific background color from an image, creating a transparent background where the target color was present.

### Third Party Libaries

# encodeImage index.js
## Imported Code Object
Certainly! Here's a concise explanation of the `encodeImage` function in the given code snippet:

The `encodeImage` function takes an image file path as input and performs the following steps:

1. It reads the contents of the image file using `fs.readFileSync()`.
2. It converts the binary image data into a Buffer object.
3. It then encodes the Buffer into a base64 string using `toString('base64')`.

The purpose of this function is to convert an image file into a base64-encoded string representation, which can be useful for embedding images directly in text-based formats or transmitting image data over text-based protocols.

### Third Party Libaries

No, this function does not use any third-party APIs or libraries; it only uses Node.js built-in modules (fs and Buffer) to read an image file and encode it to base64.

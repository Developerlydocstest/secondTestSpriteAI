# encodeImage index.js
## Imported Code Object
Certainly! Here's a concise explanation of `encodeImage` in the given code snippet:

The `encodeImage` function takes an image file path as input and performs the following steps:

1. It reads the contents of the image file using `fs.readFileSync()`.
2. It creates a `Buffer` object from the image data.
3. It converts the `Buffer` to a base64-encoded string using `toString('base64')`.

The purpose of this function is to convert an image file into a base64-encoded string representation. This encoded string can be used to embed the image directly in HTML or to transmit the image data over text-based protocols.

### Third Party Libaries

No, this function does not use any third-party APIs or libraries; it only uses built-in Node.js modules (fs and Buffer) to read an image file and encode it to base64.

# getUniqueColors index.js
## Imported Code Object
`getUniqueColors` is an asynchronous function that takes an image file path and optional parameters as input. Its purpose is to analyze the image and return an array of unique colors found in the image. Here's what it does:

1. It reads the image file using the Jimp library.
2. It creates a Set to store unique colors.
3. It scans every pixel of the image, extracting the RGBA values.
4. For each non-transparent pixel, it converts the RGBA values to an integer representation of the color.
5. It adds this color integer to the Set, which automatically ensures uniqueness.
6. Finally, it converts the Set of unique colors back to an array and returns it.

This function is useful for analyzing the color palette of an image or for tasks that require knowledge of the distinct colors used in an image.

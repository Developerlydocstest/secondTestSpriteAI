# removeBackgroundColor index.js
## Imported Code Object
The `removeBackgroundColor` function is an asynchronous function designed to remove a specified background color from an image. Here's a concise explanation of its purpose and functionality:

1. It takes an input image path, output path, target color, and optional parameters.
2. The function uses the Jimp library to process the image.
3. It scans through each pixel of the image.
4. For each pixel, it compares its color to the specified target color.
5. If the color difference is within a given threshold, it makes that pixel transparent.
6. The resulting image with the removed background is then saved to the specified output path.

In essence, this function automates the process of removing a specific background color from an image, which can be useful for tasks like creating transparent PNGs or isolating objects in images.

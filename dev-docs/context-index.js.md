# removeBackgroundColor index.js
## Imported Code Object
The `removeBackgroundColor` function is an asynchronous operation that processes an image to remove a specified background color. Here's a concise explanation:

1. It takes an input image path, output path, target color, and optional parameters.
2. The function uses the Jimp library to read and manipulate the image.
3. It scans through each pixel of the image.
4. For each pixel, it compares its color to the specified target color.
5. If the color difference is within the given threshold, it makes that pixel transparent.
6. Finally, it saves the processed image to the output path.

In essence, this function allows you to remove a specific background color from an image, replacing it with transparency.

# encodeImage index.js
## Imported Code Object
Certainly! Here's a concise explanation of the `encodeImage` function in the given code snippet:

The `encodeImage` function takes an image file path as input and performs the following steps:

1. It reads the contents of the image file using `fs.readFileSync()`.
2. It converts the file contents into a Buffer object.
3. It then converts the Buffer to a base64-encoded string using `toString('base64')`.

The purpose of this function is to convert an image file into a base64-encoded string representation, which can be useful for embedding images in JSON, sending them over networks, or storing them in databases that don't support binary data directly.

# encodeImage index.js
## Imported Code Object
Certainly! Here's a concise explanation of the `encodeImage` function:

The `encodeImage` function takes an image file path as input and converts the image into a Base64-encoded string. It does this by:

1. Reading the image file using `fs.readFileSync()`.
2. Converting the file contents into a Buffer.
3. Encoding the Buffer to a Base64 string using `toString('base64')`.

This Base64-encoded string can be used to represent the image data in a text format, which is useful for transmitting images over text-based protocols or storing them in databases that don't support binary data directly.

### Third Party Libaries

No, this function does not use any third-party APIs or libraries; it only uses Node.js built-in modules (fs and Buffer) to read an image file and encode it to base64.

# getUniqueColors index.js
## Imported Code Object
In this code snippet, `getUniqueColors` is an asynchronous function that takes an image file path as input and returns an array of unique colors found in the image. Here's a concise explanation of what it does:

1. It reads the image file using the Jimp library.
2. It scans through each pixel of the image.
3. For each non-transparent pixel, it converts the RGBA values to an integer representation of the color.
4. It adds each unique color (as an integer) to a Set to eliminate duplicates.
5. Finally, it returns an array of all unique colors found in the image.

This function is useful for analyzing the color palette of an image or for tasks that require knowledge of the distinct colors used in an image.

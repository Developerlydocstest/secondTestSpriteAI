# getUniqueColors index.js
## Imported Code Object

The getUniqueColors async function takes an image path and options as inputs. It uses the Jimp library to read the image from the provided path. It then iterates through every pixel in the image, extracts the red, green, blue and alpha values from each one, converts those values to a numeric color integer if the pixel isn't fully transparent, and adds each unique color integer to a Set. This Set will only contain unique color values. The function returns an array containing all the unique color integer values found in the image.

# undefined index.js
## Imported Code Object

undefined in JavaScript refers to a value that has not been assigned or declared. When a variable is declared but not initialized, its value is undefined. It is also returned from functions that don't explicitly return a value. So in the code snippet provided, undefined is likely a variable that has been declared but has no value assigned to it yet.

# removeBackgroundColor index.js
## Imported Code Object

The removeBackgroundColor function takes in an input image path, output image path, target color to remove, a color threshold, and options. 

It reads the input image, defines the target color to replace with transparency, loops through all pixels, calculates the color difference from the target color, and makes pixels transparent if they are within the color threshold.

Finally it writes out the processed image with the background color removed to the output path.

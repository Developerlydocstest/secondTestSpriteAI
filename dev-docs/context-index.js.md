# getUniqueColors index.js
## Imported Code Object
The `getUniqueColors` function is an asynchronous function that takes an image file path (`imagePath`) and an optional `options` object as input. Its purpose is to read the image file, scan through all its pixels, and return an array of unique color values present in the image.

Here's a breakdown of what the function does:

1. It uses the `Jimp` library to read the image file asynchronously using `Jimp.read(imagePath)`.
2. It creates a new `Set` object called `colorSet` to store unique color values.
3. It scans through every pixel of the image using the `image.scan` method, which provides the pixel coordinates (`x`, `y`) and the index (`idx`) of the current pixel in the image data array.
4. For each pixel, it extracts the red, green, blue, and alpha (transparency) values from the image data array using the provided pixel index.
5. If the pixel is not fully transparent (alpha value is not 0), it converts the red, green, blue, and alpha values into a single integer value using the `Jimp.rgbaToInt` function.
6. It adds this integer color value to the `colorSet` using the `colorSet.add` method. The `Set` data structure ensures that only unique color values are stored.
7. After scanning through all pixels, it converts the `colorSet` back into an array using `Array.from(colorSet)` and returns this array of unique color values.

The returned array contains integer color values representing the unique colors present in the image. Each integer value encodes the red, green, blue, and alpha components of a color in a single 32-bit integer.

The `options` parameter is currently unused in the provided code snippet, but it can potentially be used to pass additional configuration options to the function, such as specifying color quantization or handling transparency in a different way.

### Sample Parameters For Code Feature Fridays

Sure, the `getUniqueColors` function takes two arguments:

1. `imagePath` (required): A string representing the path to the image file you want to analyze.
2. `options` (optional): An object containing additional options for the analysis. In the provided code, this argument is not used, but you can add additional options if needed.

Here's an example of how you can use the `getUniqueColors` function:

```javascript
const imagePath = './path/to/your/image.jpg';

getUniqueColors(imagePath)
  .then(colors => {
    console.log('Unique colors found:', colors);
    // Do something with the unique colors
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error('Error:', error);
  });
```

In this example, we pass the path to the image file (`'./path/to/your/image.jpg'`) as the `imagePath` argument. The function returns a Promise that resolves with an array of unique color integers (represented as numbers) found in the image.

If you want to pass additional options, you can do so by providing an object as the second argument:

```javascript
const imagePath = './path/to/your/image.jpg';
const options = {
  // Add your custom options here
};

getUniqueColors(imagePath, options)
  .then(colors => {
    console.log('Unique colors found:', colors);
    // Do something with the unique colors
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error('Error:', error);
  });
```

Note that the provided code uses the `Jimp` library for image processing, so you'll need to install and import it before running the `getUniqueColors` function.

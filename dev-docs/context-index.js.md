# getUniqueColors index.js
## Imported Code Object

The getUniqueColors async function takes an image path and options as inputs. It uses the Jimp library to read the image from the provided path. It then iterates through every pixel in the image, extracts the red, green, blue and alpha values from each one, converts those values to a single integer color representation if the pixel isn't fully transparent, and adds those color integers to a Set. This Set will only contain unique color values. The function returns an array containing all the unique colors found in the image.

# undefined index.js
## Imported Code Object

undefined in JavaScript refers to a value that has not been assigned or declared. When a variable is declared but not initialized, its value is undefined. It is also returned from functions that don't explicitly return a value. So in the code snippet provided, undefined is likely a variable that has been declared but has no value assigned to it yet.

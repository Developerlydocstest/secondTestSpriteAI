# encodeImage index.js
## Imported Code Object
Certainly! Here's a concise explanation of the `encodeImage` function in the given code snippet:

The `encodeImage` function takes an image file path as input and performs the following steps:

1. It reads the contents of the image file using `fs.readFileSync()`.
2. It converts the file contents into a Buffer object.
3. It then encodes the Buffer into a base64 string representation.
4. Finally, it returns the base64-encoded string of the image.

This function is commonly used to convert image files into a format that can be easily transmitted or stored as text, such as when sending images over APIs or storing them in databases that don't support binary data directly.

### Third Party Libaries

No, this function does not use any third-party APIs or libraries; it only uses the built-in Node.js modules 'fs' and 'Buffer' to read and encode the image file.

# getUniqueColors index.js
## Imported Code Object
In this code snippet, `getUniqueColors` is an asynchronous function that takes an image file path and optional parameters as input. Its purpose is to analyze the image and return an array of unique colors found in the image.

The function performs the following steps:
1. Reads the image file using the Jimp library.
2. Scans through each pixel of the image.
3. For each non-transparent pixel, it extracts the RGBA color values.
4. Converts the RGBA values to an integer representation of the color.
5. Adds the color integer to a Set to ensure uniqueness.
6. Finally, it converts the Set of unique colors to an array and returns it.

This function is useful for identifying and extracting the palette of colors used in an image.

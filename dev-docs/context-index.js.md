# removeBackgroundColor index.js
## Imported Code Object
The `removeBackgroundColor` function is an asynchronous function that processes an image to remove a specific background color, making it transparent. Here's a concise explanation:

1. It takes an input image path, output path, target color to remove, and optional color threshold and options.

2. It uses the Jimp library to read and manipulate the image.

3. The function scans each pixel of the image, comparing its color to the target color.

4. If a pixel's color is within the specified threshold of the target color, it sets that pixel's alpha channel to 0, making it transparent.

5. Finally, it saves the processed image with the transparent background to the specified output path.

This function is useful for removing specific background colors from images, which can be helpful in various image processing tasks or when preparing images for overlays or compositions.

# encodeImage index.js
## Imported Code Object
Certainly! Here's a concise explanation of the `encodeImage` function in the given code snippet:

The `encodeImage` function takes an image file path as input and converts the image into a Base64-encoded string. Here's what it does:

1. It reads the contents of the image file using `fs.readFileSync()`.
2. It creates a Buffer from the image data.
3. It converts the Buffer to a Base64-encoded string using `toString('base64')`.

This Base64 encoding allows the image data to be represented as a text string, which can be useful for transmitting images over text-based protocols or storing them in databases that don't support binary data directly.

### Third Party Libaries

No, this function does not use any third-party APIs or libraries; it only uses Node.js built-in modules (fs and Buffer) to read an image file and encode it to base64.

# getUniqueColors index.js
## Imported Code Object
In this code snippet, `getUniqueColors` is an asynchronous function that takes an image file path as input and returns an array of unique colors found in the image. Here's a concise explanation of what it does:

1. It reads the image file using Jimp library.
2. It scans through every pixel of the image.
3. For each non-transparent pixel, it extracts the RGBA values.
4. It converts the RGBA values to an integer representation of the color.
5. It adds this color integer to a Set, which automatically ensures uniqueness.
6. Finally, it converts the Set of unique colors back to an array and returns it.

The function essentially processes an image to identify and return a list of all unique colors present in the image, excluding fully transparent pixels.

### Third Party Libaries

Yes, this function uses the third-party library Jimp (JavaScript Image Manipulation Program) for reading and processing the image.

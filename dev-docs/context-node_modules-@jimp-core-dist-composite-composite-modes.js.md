# srcOver node_modules/@jimp/core/dist/composite/composite-modes.js
## Imported Code Object
The `srcOver` function implements the "source over" alpha compositing operation, which is a common method for blending two colors with transparency. Here's a concise explanation:

1. It takes a source color (`src`) and a destination color (`dst`), both with rgba components.
2. An optional `ops` parameter can adjust the source alpha.
3. It calculates the resulting color by blending the source color over the destination color, considering their alpha values.
4. The function returns a new color object with the blended rgba values.

This operation is often used in computer graphics for layering semi-transparent colors or images on top of each other.

### Third Party Libaries

No, this function does not use any third-party APIs or libraries; it only uses basic JavaScript operations and arithmetic to perform color blending calculations.

### Code Example

Certainly! Here's a brief code example demonstrating how to use the `srcOver` function:

```javascript
// Define two colors: source and destination
const sourceColor = { r: 255, g: 0, b: 0, a: 0.5 }; // Semi-transparent red
const destColor = { r: 0, g: 0, b: 255, a: 1 }; // Solid blue

// Call the srcOver function
const resultColor = srcOver(sourceColor, destColor);

// Log the result
console.log("Resulting color:", resultColor);
```

In this example:

1. We define two colors:
   - `sourceColor`: A semi-transparent red (rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.5))
   - `destColor`: A solid blue (rgba(0, 0, 255, 1))

2. We call the `srcOver` function, passing the source and destination colors as arguments.

3. The function calculates the resulting color based on the source-over compositing operation.

4. We log the resulting color to the console.

The `srcOver` function implements the "source over destination" alpha compositing operation, which is commonly used in graphics programming to blend a source color over a destination color, taking into account their alpha (transparency) values.

You can adjust the color values and alpha levels to see how different combinations affect the result. Additionally, you can provide a third argument to the `srcOver` function to adjust the opacity of the source color if needed:

```javascript
// Example with custom opacity
const resultWithCustomOpacity = srcOver(sourceColor, destColor, 0.8);
console.log("Result with custom opacity:", resultWithCustomOpacity);
```

This would apply the source-over operation with the source color at 80% of its original opacity.

# dstOver node_modules/@jimp/core/dist/composite/composite-modes.js
## Imported Code Object
The `dstOver` function implements the "destination-over" alpha compositing operation. This blending mode places the source pixel behind the destination pixel. Here's a concise explanation:

1. It takes two objects, `src` (source) and `dst` (destination), representing pixels with RGBA values.
2. An optional `ops` parameter adjusts the source alpha.
3. It calculates the final alpha and color values based on the alpha compositing formula for "destination-over".
4. The function returns a new object with the resulting RGBA values.

This operation is useful in graphics programming for layering semi-transparent images or elements, ensuring that the destination appears on top of the source.

### Third Party Libaries

No, this function does not use any third-party APIs or libraries; it only uses standard JavaScript syntax and arithmetic operations to perform color blending calculations.

### Code Example

Certainly! Here's a brief code example demonstrating how to use the `dstOver` function:

```javascript
// Define two color objects with RGBA values
const sourceColor = { r: 255, g: 0, b: 0, a: 0.5 };  // Semi-transparent red
const destinationColor = { r: 0, g: 0, b: 255, a: 1 };  // Fully opaque blue

// Call the dstOver function
const result = dstOver(sourceColor, destinationColor);

// Log the result
console.log(result);
```

In this example:

1. We define two color objects: `sourceColor` (semi-transparent red) and `destinationColor` (fully opaque blue).

2. We call the `dstOver` function, passing these two color objects as arguments.

3. The function performs the destination-over compositing operation and returns a new color object.

4. We log the result to the console.

The `dstOver` function implements the "destination-over" compositing operation, where the source color is composited behind the destination color. The resulting color will be a blend of the two input colors, with the exact result depending on their alpha values.

You can also provide an optional third argument to adjust the opacity of the source color:

```javascript
// Using the optional opacity parameter
const result = dstOver(sourceColor, destinationColor, 0.8);
```

This would apply the source color at 80% of its original opacity before compositing.

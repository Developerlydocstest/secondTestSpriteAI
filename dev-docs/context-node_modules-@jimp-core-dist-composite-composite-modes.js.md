# srcOver node_modules/@jimp/core/dist/composite/composite-modes.js
## Imported Code Object
The `srcOver` function implements the "source over" alpha compositing operation, which is a common method for blending two colors with transparency. Here's a concise explanation:

1. It takes a source color (`src`) and a destination color (`dst`), both with rgba components.
2. An optional `ops` parameter can adjust the source alpha.
3. It calculates the resulting color by blending the source color over the destination color, considering their alpha values.
4. The function returns a new color object with the blended rgba values.

This operation is often used in computer graphics for layering semi-transparent colors or images on top of each other.

### Third Party Libaries

No, this function does not use any third-party APIs or libraries; it only uses basic JavaScript operations and arithmetic to perform color blending calculations.

### Code Example

Certainly! Here's a brief code example demonstrating how to use the `srcOver` function:

```javascript
// Define two colors: source and destination
const sourceColor = { r: 255, g: 0, b: 0, a: 0.5 }; // Semi-transparent red
const destColor = { r: 0, g: 0, b: 255, a: 1 }; // Solid blue

// Call the srcOver function
const resultColor = srcOver(sourceColor, destColor);

// Log the result
console.log("Resulting color:", resultColor);
```

In this example:

1. We define two colors:
   - `sourceColor`: A semi-transparent red (rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.5))
   - `destColor`: A solid blue (rgba(0, 0, 255, 1))

2. We call the `srcOver` function, passing the source and destination colors as arguments.

3. The function calculates the resulting color based on the source-over compositing operation.

4. We log the resulting color to the console.

The `srcOver` function implements the "source over destination" alpha compositing operation, which is commonly used in graphics programming to blend a source color over a destination color, taking into account their alpha (transparency) values.

You can adjust the color values and alpha levels to see how different combinations affect the result. Additionally, you can provide a third argument to the `srcOver` function to adjust the opacity of the source color if needed:

```javascript
// Example with custom opacity
const resultWithCustomOpacity = srcOver(sourceColor, destColor, 0.8);
console.log("Result with custom opacity:", resultWithCustomOpacity);
```

This would apply the source-over operation with the source color at 80% of its original opacity.

# dstOver node_modules/@jimp/core/dist/composite/composite-modes.js
## Imported Code Object
The `dstOver` function implements the "destination-over" alpha compositing operation. This blending mode places the source pixel behind the destination pixel. Here's a concise explanation:

1. It takes two objects, `src` (source) and `dst` (destination), representing pixels with RGBA values.
2. An optional `ops` parameter adjusts the source alpha.
3. It calculates the final alpha and color values based on the alpha compositing formula for "destination-over".
4. The function returns a new object with the resulting RGBA values.

This operation is useful in graphics programming for layering semi-transparent images or elements, ensuring that the destination appears on top of the source.

### Third Party Libaries

No, this function does not use any third-party APIs or libraries; it only uses standard JavaScript syntax and arithmetic operations to perform color blending calculations.

### Code Example

Certainly! Here's a brief code example demonstrating how to use the `dstOver` function:

```javascript
// Define two color objects with RGBA values
const sourceColor = { r: 255, g: 0, b: 0, a: 0.5 };  // Semi-transparent red
const destinationColor = { r: 0, g: 0, b: 255, a: 1 };  // Fully opaque blue

// Call the dstOver function
const result = dstOver(sourceColor, destinationColor);

// Log the result
console.log(result);
```

In this example:

1. We define two color objects: `sourceColor` (semi-transparent red) and `destinationColor` (fully opaque blue).

2. We call the `dstOver` function, passing these two color objects as arguments.

3. The function performs the destination-over compositing operation and returns a new color object.

4. We log the result to the console.

The `dstOver` function implements the "destination-over" compositing operation, where the source color is composited behind the destination color. The resulting color will be a blend of the two input colors, with the exact result depending on their alpha values.

You can also provide an optional third argument to adjust the opacity of the source color:

```javascript
// Using the optional opacity parameter
const result = dstOver(sourceColor, destinationColor, 0.8);
```

This would apply the source color at 80% of its original opacity before compositing.

# multiply node_modules/@jimp/core/dist/composite/composite-modes.js
## Imported Code Object
In this code snippet, `multiply` is a function that performs a blend operation similar to the "Multiply" blend mode in image editing software. Here's a concise explanation:

1. It takes two color objects (`src` and `dst`) as input, each with r, g, b, and a (alpha) properties.
2. An optional `ops` parameter can be provided to adjust the source alpha.
3. The function calculates new color values by multiplying the source and destination colors, considering their alpha values.
4. It uses a formula that simulates the multiply blend mode, which generally darkens the image.
5. The result is a new color object with blended r, g, b, and a values.

This function is likely used in a graphics or image processing context to combine or blend colors in a way that mimics the multiply blending mode.

### Third Party Libaries

No, this function does not use any third-party APIs or libraries; it performs calculations using standard JavaScript arithmetic operations and object properties.

### Code Example

Certainly! Here's a brief code example demonstrating how to use the `multiply` function:

```javascript
// Define two color objects with RGBA values
const sourceColor = { r: 0.8, g: 0.5, b: 0.2, a: 0.7 };
const destinationColor = { r: 0.3, g: 0.6, b: 0.9, a: 0.5 };

// Call the multiply function
const result = multiply(sourceColor, destinationColor);

// Log the result
console.log("Result:", result);

// You can also use the optional 'ops' parameter
const resultWithOps = multiply(sourceColor, destinationColor, 0.5);
console.log("Result with ops:", resultWithOps);
```

In this example:

1. We define two color objects, `sourceColor` and `destinationColor`, each with `r`, `g`, `b`, and `a` properties representing the red, green, blue, and alpha channels respectively.

2. We call the `multiply` function with these two color objects as arguments.

3. The function returns a new color object with the result of the multiplication blend operation.

4. We log the result to the console.

5. We also demonstrate using the optional `ops` parameter by calling the function again with a value of 0.5.

Remember that this function expects color values to be in the range of 0 to 1. If you're working with 8-bit color values (0-255), you'll need to normalize them before passing them to this function and denormalize the result afterwards.

# add node_modules/@jimp/core/dist/composite/composite-modes.js
## Imported Code Object
In this code snippet, `add` is a function that performs color blending using the "additive" blending mode. Here's a concise explanation:

1. It takes two color objects (`src` and `dst`) and an optional `ops` parameter.
2. It multiplies the source alpha by `ops`.
3. It calculates a new alpha value `a` by combining the source and destination alphas.
4. It computes premultiplied color values for both source and destination.
5. It blends the colors by adding the premultiplied values and dividing by the new alpha.
6. Finally, it returns a new color object with the blended values.

This function essentially adds the colors together, taking into account their alpha values, resulting in a brighter combined color.

### Third Party Libaries

No, this function does not use any third-party APIs or libraries; it only uses standard JavaScript syntax and arithmetic operations.

### Code Example

Certainly! Here's a brief code example of how to use the `add` function:

```javascript
// Define two color objects
const color1 = { r: 0.5, g: 0.3, b: 0.2, a: 0.8 };
const color2 = { r: 0.7, g: 0.6, b: 0.4, a: 0.6 };

// Call the add function
const result = add(color1, color2);

// Log the result
console.log(result);
```

In this example:

1. We define two color objects, `color1` and `color2`, each with `r`, `g`, `b`, and `a` properties representing red, green, blue, and alpha values respectively. These values should be in the range of 0 to 1.

2. We call the `add` function, passing `color1` as the source (`src`) and `color2` as the destination (`dst`).

3. The function returns a new color object that is the result of adding `color1` to `color2` using the add blending mode.

4. We log the result to the console.

You can also use the optional third parameter `ops` to adjust the opacity of the source color:

```javascript
// Call the add function with custom opacity
const resultWithCustomOpacity = add(color1, color2, 0.5);

console.log(resultWithCustomOpacity);
```

In this case, the `ops` parameter is set to 0.5, which will multiply the alpha value of `color1` by 0.5 before performing the addition.

Remember that this function assumes that the color values are in the range of 0 to 1. If you're working with 8-bit color values (0-255), you'll need to normalize them before passing them to the function, and denormalize the result afterwards.

# screen node_modules/@jimp/core/dist/composite/composite-modes.js
## Imported Code Object
The `screen` function in this code snippet implements the Screen blending mode, which is commonly used in image processing and computer graphics. Here's a concise explanation:

1. The function takes two color objects (`src` and `dst`) and an optional opacity parameter (`ops`).

2. It calculates a new alpha value (`a`) by combining the alpha values of both colors.

3. For each color channel (red, green, blue), it applies the Screen blending formula:
   Result = 1 - (1 - Source) * (1 - Destination)

4. The formula is adapted to handle alpha transparency for both source and destination colors.

5. The function returns a new color object with the blended red, green, blue, and alpha values.

The Screen blending mode typically results in a lighter image, often used for creating glowing or bright effects when compositing images or applying visual effects.

### Third Party Libaries

No, this function does not use any third-party APIs or libraries; it's a standalone JavaScript function performing calculations using standard arithmetic operations.

### Code Example

Certainly! Here's a brief code example demonstrating how to use the `screen` function:

```javascript
// Define two color objects representing the source and destination colors
const sourceColor = { r: 0.8, g: 0.5, b: 0.2, a: 0.7 };
const destColor = { r: 0.3, g: 0.6, b: 0.9, a: 0.8 };

// Call the screen function with the source and destination colors
const result = screen(sourceColor, destColor);

// Optional: You can pass a third argument to adjust the opacity
// const result = screen(sourceColor, destColor, 0.5);

// Log the resulting color
console.log("Resulting color:");
console.log("R:", result.r);
console.log("G:", result.g);
console.log("B:", result.b);
console.log("A:", result.a);
```

In this example:

1. We define two color objects, `sourceColor` and `destColor`, each with `r`, `g`, `b`, and `a` properties representing the red, green, blue, and alpha (opacity) values respectively. These values should be in the range of 0 to 1.

2. We call the `screen` function, passing `sourceColor` as the first argument and `destColor` as the second argument.

3. The function returns a new color object with the result of the screen blending operation.

4. We log the resulting color values to the console.

Note that you can also pass an optional third argument to the `screen` function to adjust the opacity of the operation. If you don't provide this argument, it defaults to 1 (full opacity).

This code demonstrates how to use the `screen` function to blend two colors using the screen blending mode, which is often used in image processing and graphics applications.

# overlay node_modules/@jimp/core/dist/composite/composite-modes.js
## Imported Code Object
The `overlay` function in this code snippet implements the overlay blending mode, which is a common technique used in image processing and graphics. Here's a concise explanation:

1. The function takes two color objects (`src` and `dst`) as input, each with r, g, b, and a components (red, green, blue, and alpha).

2. It also accepts an optional opacity parameter (`ops`) that adjusts the source alpha.

3. The function calculates the resulting color by applying the overlay blend mode formula:
   - If the destination color is light (2 * component <= alpha), it multiplies the colors.
   - If the destination color is dark (2 * component > alpha), it uses screen blending.

4. The alpha channel is combined using the standard alpha compositing formula.

5. The function returns a new color object with the blended r, g, b, and a values.

This overlay blend mode creates a contrast effect, making light colors lighter and dark colors darker, while preserving highlights and shadows.

### Third Party Libaries

No, this function does not use any third-party APIs or libraries; it's a standalone implementation of an overlay blending operation using pure JavaScript.

### Code Example

Certainly! Here's a brief code example demonstrating how to use the `overlay` function:

```javascript
// Define two colors: source and destination
const sourceColor = { r: 1, g: 0, b: 0, a: 0.5 }; // Semi-transparent red
const destColor = { r: 0, g: 1, b: 0, a: 1 }; // Opaque green

// Call the overlay function
const resultColor = overlay(sourceColor, destColor);

// Optional: Specify opacity (third argument)
// const resultColor = overlay(sourceColor, destColor, 0.7);

// Log the result
console.log("Resulting color:", resultColor);
```

In this example:

1. We define two colors: `sourceColor` (semi-transparent red) and `destColor` (opaque green).

2. We call the `overlay` function with these two colors as arguments.

3. The function returns a new color object that represents the result of overlaying the source color on the destination color.

4. We log the resulting color to the console.

Note that the `overlay` function expects color components (r, g, b, a) to be in the range of 0 to 1. If your color values are in the range of 0-255, you'll need to normalize them before passing them to the function.

Also, the third argument `ops` is optional. If you want to adjust the opacity of the source color before overlaying, you can pass a value between 0 and 1 as the third argument.

Remember that this function implements the "overlay" blending mode, which is just one of many possible blending modes. The result will depend on the specific colors and alpha values you provide.

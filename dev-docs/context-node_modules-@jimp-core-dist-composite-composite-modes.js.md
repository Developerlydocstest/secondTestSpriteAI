# srcOver node_modules/@jimp/core/dist/composite/composite-modes.js
## Imported Code Object
The `srcOver` function implements the "source over" alpha compositing operation, which is a common method for blending two colors with transparency. Here's a concise explanation:

1. It takes a source color (`src`) and a destination color (`dst`), both with rgba components.
2. An optional `ops` parameter can adjust the source alpha.
3. It calculates the resulting color by blending the source color over the destination color, considering their alpha values.
4. The function returns a new color object with the blended rgba values.

This operation is often used in computer graphics for layering semi-transparent colors or images on top of each other.

### Third Party Libaries

No, this function does not use any third-party APIs or libraries; it only uses basic JavaScript operations and arithmetic to perform color blending calculations.

### Code Example

Certainly! Here's a brief code example demonstrating how to use the `srcOver` function:

```javascript
// Define two colors: source and destination
const sourceColor = { r: 255, g: 0, b: 0, a: 0.5 }; // Semi-transparent red
const destColor = { r: 0, g: 0, b: 255, a: 1 }; // Solid blue

// Call the srcOver function
const resultColor = srcOver(sourceColor, destColor);

// Log the result
console.log("Resulting color:", resultColor);
```

In this example:

1. We define two colors:
   - `sourceColor`: A semi-transparent red (rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.5))
   - `destColor`: A solid blue (rgba(0, 0, 255, 1))

2. We call the `srcOver` function, passing the source and destination colors as arguments.

3. The function calculates the resulting color based on the source-over compositing operation.

4. We log the resulting color to the console.

The `srcOver` function implements the "source over destination" alpha compositing operation, which is commonly used in graphics programming to blend a source color over a destination color, taking into account their alpha (transparency) values.

You can adjust the color values and alpha levels to see how different combinations affect the result. Additionally, you can provide a third argument to the `srcOver` function to adjust the opacity of the source color if needed:

```javascript
// Example with custom opacity
const resultWithCustomOpacity = srcOver(sourceColor, destColor, 0.8);
console.log("Result with custom opacity:", resultWithCustomOpacity);
```

This would apply the source-over operation with the source color at 80% of its original opacity.

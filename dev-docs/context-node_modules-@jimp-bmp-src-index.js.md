# toAGBR node_modules/@jimp/bmp/src/index.js
## Imported Code Object
The `toAGBR` function in this code snippet is transforming the color format of an image from RGBA (Red, Green, Blue, Alpha) to AGBR (Alpha, Green, Blue, Red). Here's what it does:

1. It scans through each pixel of the image.
2. For each pixel, it reads the RGBA values.
3. It then rearranges these values to AGBR format:
   - Alpha becomes the first channel
   - Blue becomes the second channel
   - Green becomes the third channel
   - Red becomes the fourth channel
4. This transformed data is then written back to the image.

The function essentially swaps the positions of the color channels in the image data, changing how the image data is stored but not necessarily changing how the image looks visually.

### Third Party Libaries

The function `toAGBR` does not directly use any third-party APIs or libraries, but it appears to be using methods (`scan` and accessing `bitmap`) that are likely provided by an image processing library, possibly Jimp.

### Code Example

Certainly! Here's a brief code example demonstrating how to use the `toAGBR` function:

```javascript
const Jimp = require('jimp');

// Assuming the toAGBR function is defined as you provided

async function convertImageToAGBR(inputPath, outputPath) {
  try {
    // Read the input image
    const image = await Jimp.read(inputPath);

    // Apply the toAGBR conversion
    const agbrBitmap = toAGBR(image);

    // Create a new Jimp image with the converted bitmap
    const convertedImage = new Jimp(agbrBitmap);

    // Save the converted image
    await convertedImage.writeAsync(outputPath);

    console.log('Image converted and saved successfully!');
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error converting image:', error);
  }
}

// Usage example
const inputImagePath = 'path/to/input/image.png';
const outputImagePath = 'path/to/output/image_agbr.png';

convertImageToAGBR(inputImagePath, outputImagePath);
```

In this example:

1. We import the Jimp library, which is commonly used for image processing in Node.js.

2. We define an async function `convertImageToAGBR` that takes an input image path and an output image path.

3. Inside the function, we:
   - Read the input image using `Jimp.read()`.
   - Apply the `toAGBR` conversion to the image.
   - Create a new Jimp image with the converted bitmap.
   - Save the converted image to the specified output path.

4. We provide an example usage of the function by specifying input and output image paths and calling `convertImageToAGBR`.

Make sure you have the Jimp library installed (`npm install jimp`) and that the `toAGBR` function is available in your code. Also, replace the input and output paths with actual file paths on your system.

This example demonstrates how to use the `toAGBR` function to convert an image to the AGBR format and save the result.

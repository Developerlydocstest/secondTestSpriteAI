# _getRequireWildcardCache node_modules/@jimp/core/dist/composite/index.js
## Imported Code Object
Certainly! Here's a concise explanation of `_getRequireWildcardCache`:

`_getRequireWildcardCache` is a helper function used in module systems, particularly in transpiled JavaScript code. Its purpose is to create and manage caches for wildcard imports. Here's what it does:

1. It checks if `WeakMap` is available in the environment.
2. If available, it creates two `WeakMap` instances: one for Babel interop and one for Node.js interop.
3. It returns a function that, when called, selects the appropriate cache based on the `nodeInterop` parameter.
4. This returned function is memoized, so subsequent calls reuse the same caches.

The function helps optimize performance when dealing with dynamic imports and interoperability between different module systems, particularly in transpiled code generated by tools like Babel.

### Third Party Libaries

No, this function does not use any third-party APIs or libraries; it only uses built-in JavaScript features like WeakMap and basic conditional logic.

### Code Example

Certainly! The `_getRequireWildcardCache` function is typically used in transpiled code, especially in the context of module imports. It's not something you would usually write or use directly in your own code. However, I can provide an example of how it might be used in a transpiled module system:

```javascript
function _interopRequireWildcard(obj, nodeInterop) {
  if (!nodeInterop && obj && obj.__esModule) {
    return obj;
  }

  if (obj === null || (typeof obj !== "object" && typeof obj !== "function")) {
    return { default: obj };
  }

  var cache = _getRequireWildcardCache(nodeInterop);

  if (cache && cache.has(obj)) {
    return cache.get(obj);
  }

  var newObj = {};
  var hasPropertyDescriptor = Object.defineProperty && Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor;

  for (var key in obj) {
    if (key !== "default" && Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(obj, key)) {
      var desc = hasPropertyDescriptor
        ? Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(obj, key)
        : null;
      if (desc && (desc.get || desc.set)) {
        Object.defineProperty(newObj, key, desc);
      } else {
        newObj[key] = obj[key];
      }
    }
  }

  newObj.default = obj;

  if (cache) {
    cache.set(obj, newObj);
  }

  return newObj;
}

// Usage example
const myModule = _interopRequireWildcard(require('some-module'), false);
```

In this example:

1. `_getRequireWildcardCache` is used within the `_interopRequireWildcard` function.
2. It's called with a boolean parameter (`nodeInterop`) to determine which cache to use.
3. The returned cache (either `cacheNodeInterop` or `cacheBabelInterop`) is then used to store and retrieve interop results.

This caching mechanism helps optimize performance when dealing with wildcard imports in a transpiled environment, especially when the same module is imported multiple times.

Remember, this is typically part of the output of a transpiler like Babel and not something you'd write manually in your day-to-day JavaScript code.

# _interopRequireWildcard node_modules/@jimp/core/dist/composite/index.js
## Imported Code Object
The `_interopRequireWildcard` function is a utility used in JavaScript module systems, particularly in transpiled code (e.g., Babel output). Its purpose is to handle interoperability between different module formats, specifically CommonJS and ES modules.

Here's what it does:

1. If the object is an ES module (has `__esModule` property), it returns the object as-is.
2. If the object is null or not an object/function, it wraps it in an object with a `default` property.
3. It uses a cache to avoid repeated processing of the same object.
4. For other cases, it creates a new object that:
   - Copies all properties except "default" from the original object.
   - Sets the original object as the `default` property.

This ensures that whether you're dealing with a CommonJS module or an ES module, you can consistently access its exports, either as properties of the object or via the `default` property.

### Third Party Libaries

No, this function does not use any third-party APIs or libraries; it only uses built-in JavaScript features and objects.

### Code Example

The `_interopRequireWildcard` function is typically used in transpiled JavaScript code, particularly when working with ES modules in environments that don't natively support them. It's often used in conjunction with Babel or similar tools.

Here's a brief example of how you might use this function:

```javascript
// Assuming this is in a file that's been transpiled by Babel or a similar tool

// Import the _interopRequireWildcard function
var _interopRequireWildcard = require("@babel/runtime/helpers/interopRequireWildcard");

// Use it when importing a module
var _myModule = _interopRequireWildcard(require("./myModule"));

// Now you can use the imported module
console.log(_myModule.someFunction());
console.log(_myModule.default);
```

In this example:

1. We first import the `_interopRequireWildcard` function. In a real-world scenario, this would typically be done by your build tool.

2. We then use `_interopRequireWildcard` when importing another module (`./myModule` in this case).

3. The function ensures that whether `myModule` is a CommonJS module or an ES module, we can access its exports consistently.

4. We can then use the imported module, accessing both named exports and the default export.

It's important to note that you typically wouldn't write this code yourself. Instead, it would be generated by a transpiler like Babel when converting ES module syntax to a format that works in environments that don't natively support ES modules.

In a more modern JavaScript environment that supports ES modules natively, you would simply write:

```javascript
import * as myModule from './myModule';

console.log(myModule.someFunction());
console.log(myModule.default);
```

The `_interopRequireWildcard` function exists to make this same code work in environments that don't support this syntax natively.

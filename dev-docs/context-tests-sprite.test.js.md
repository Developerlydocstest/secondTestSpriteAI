Summary:
This code file contains unit tests for a sprite generation module. It uses Jest as the testing framework and tests two main functions: `generateSprite` and `generateHouseAsset`.

Main code object: sprite

Methods:

1. generateSprite(description, options)
   Generates a sprite based on the given description and options.

   Example:
   ```javascript
   const description = 'knight';
   const options = { iterations: 1 };
   const result = await sprite.generateSprite(description, options);
   ```

2. generateHouseAsset(description, options)
   Generates a house asset based on the given description and options.

   Example:
   ```javascript
   const description = 'house';
   const options = { iterations: 1 };
   const result = await sprite.generateHouseAsset(description, options);
   ```

Note: The code file focuses on testing these methods rather than implementing them. The actual implementation of these methods is likely in a separate file (possibly `index.js`).

# toAGBR node_modules/@jimp/bmp/es/index.js
## Imported Code Object
The `toAGBR` function in this code snippet is transforming the pixel data of an image from the RGBA (Red, Green, Blue, Alpha) color format to the AGBR (Alpha, Green, Blue, Red) format. Here's what it does:

1. It uses a `scan` function (likely from an image processing library) to iterate through each pixel of the image.

2. For each pixel, it:
   - Reads the RGBA values from the original bitmap data.
   - Rearranges these values to AGBR order.
   - Writes the rearranged values back to the bitmap data.

3. This transformation effectively swaps the positions of the Red and Alpha channels for each pixel in the image data.

4. After processing all pixels, it returns the modified bitmap data.

This type of color format conversion can be useful in certain image processing tasks or when working with specific file formats or systems that expect image data in a different color channel order.

### Third Party Libaries

The `toAGBR` function appears to use a `scan` function, which is likely part of a library (possibly Jimp or a similar image processing library), but without more context, it's not possible to definitively state which specific third-party library is being used.

### Code Example

Certainly! Here's a brief example of how you might use the `toAGBR` function:

```javascript
const Jimp = require('jimp');

// Assuming the toAGBR function is defined as shown in your provided code

// Load an image
Jimp.read('path/to/your/image.jpg')
  .then(image => {
    // Convert the image to AGBR format
    const agbrImage = toAGBR(image);

    // Save the AGBR image
    return Jimp.create(agbrImage.width, agbrImage.height)
      .then(newImage => {
        newImage.bitmap = agbrImage;
        return newImage.writeAsync('path/to/output/agbr_image.png');
      });
  })
  .then(() => {
    console.log('AGBR image saved successfully');
  })
  .catch(err => {
    console.error('An error occurred:', err);
  });
```

In this example:

1. We use the Jimp library to read an image file.
2. We apply the `toAGBR` function to convert the image to AGBR format.
3. We create a new Jimp image with the same dimensions as the original.
4. We set the bitmap of the new image to the AGBR bitmap.
5. We save the new AGBR image to a file.

Note that this example assumes you're using Jimp and have it installed (`npm install jimp`). Also, make sure to replace 'path/to/your/image.jpg' with the actual path to your input image, and 'path/to/output/agbr_image.png' with the desired output path.

Remember that the `toAGBR` function modifies the image data in place, changing the order of color channels from RGBA to AGBR. This can be useful for certain image processing tasks or when working with systems that expect this specific color format.

# fromAGBR node_modules/@jimp/bmp/es/index.js
## Imported Code Object
The `fromAGBR` function is designed to convert an image from AGBR (Alpha, Green, Blue, Red) color format to RGBA (Red, Green, Blue, Alpha) format. Here's what it does:

1. It takes a `bitmap` object as input.
2. It uses a `scan` function (not shown in the snippet) to iterate through each pixel of the image.
3. For each pixel, it:
   - Reads the AGBR values from the input bitmap data.
   - Rearranges these values to RGBA order.
   - Writes the rearranged values back to the bitmap data.
4. If the input bitmap has an alpha channel (`is_with_alpha` is true), it keeps the original alpha value; otherwise, it sets alpha to 255 (fully opaque).
5. Finally, it returns the modified bitmap with the color channels now in RGBA order.

This function is useful when working with image data that's in AGBR format but needs to be in the more common RGBA format for further processing or display.

### Third Party Libaries

The function `fromAGBR` does not directly use any third-party APIs or libraries based on the provided code snippet, but it does call a `scan` function which is not defined in the given code and could potentially be from an external library.

### Code Example

Certainly! Here's a brief code example of how to use the `fromAGBR` function:

```javascript
const Jimp = require('jimp');

// Assuming you have an image file in AGBR format
Jimp.read('path/to/your/agbr_image.png')
  .then((image) => {
    // Convert the image from AGBR to RGBA format
    const rgbaImage = fromAGBR(image);

    // Now you can use the converted image
    // For example, save it as a new file
    return rgbaImage.writeAsync('converted_image.png');
  })
  .then(() => {
    console.log('Image conversion completed and saved.');
  })
  .catch((err) => {
    console.error('An error occurred:', err);
  });
```

In this example:

1. We use the Jimp library to read an image file (assumed to be in AGBR format).
2. We pass the loaded image to the `fromAGBR` function, which converts it from AGBR to RGBA format.
3. The converted image is then saved as a new file.

Note that this example assumes:
- You have the Jimp library installed (`npm install jimp`).
- The `fromAGBR` function and any dependencies (like the `scan` function) are properly imported or defined in your script.
- You have an image file in AGBR format to convert.

Remember to replace `'path/to/your/agbr_image.png'` with the actual path to your AGBR image file.
